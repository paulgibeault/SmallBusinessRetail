# Project Roadmap: Modern Bakery Web Application

This roadmap outlines the development plan for building a modern and feature-rich web application for the bakery, based on the current implementation and identified gaps.

## Core Principles

*   **Mobile-First:** Design and development will prioritize mobile devices.

*   **Payment Integration (Backend & Frontend):**
    *   Integrate with a payment gateway (Stripe or PayPal).
    *   Implement API routes (`src/app/api/payment/route.ts`) for secure payment processing.

    *   Show treat details (name, description, availability) on the calendar.
    *   Enable ordering treats from the calendar.
*   **Special Requests:**
    *   Improve `src/app/special-request/page.tsx`.
    *   Implement form submission to `src/app/api/special-request/route.ts`.
    *   Integrate email sending for special requests.
    *   Provide user feedback and confirmation for requests.
* **Mobile First:**
    * implement responsive design throughout the application.
    * Test the application on mobile devices.
* **About us page:**
  * Create `src/app/about-us/page.tsx`
* **Inventory Management (Enhancements):**
    * Add a UI to make it easy to update inventory.
    * Add Real time updates (Optional)

**Deliverables:**

*   Fully functional treat calendar.
*   Working special request system.
*   Mobile friendly application.
*   About Us page.

### Phase 3: Community and Engagement

**Goal:** Build community and enhance user engagement.

**Features:**

*   **Blog (`The Crumb Trail`):**
    *   Decide on content management (Markdown, headless CMS).
    *   Create a blog listing page (`src/app/blog/page.tsx`).

*   **Newsletter:**
    *   Create a newsletter signup form.
    *   Integrate with an email service (Mailchimp, SendGrid).
    *   Create a strategy for sending newsletters.
* **Testing**
    * write comprehensive tests for the application.
