Key Platform Considerations:

Simplicity & Ease of Use: Navigation must be intuitive. The process from seeing a treat to reserving it should be seamless, especially on mobile.
Mobile-First Design: Many users will likely browse and order from their phones.
Visual Appeal: High-quality, mouth-watering photos are non-negotiable for a food business.
Inventory Management: The system must accurately track remaining quantities in real-time to avoid overselling. The "Sold Out" status needs to be prominent and automatic if possible.
Communication: Consider an email newsletter sign-up to notify subscribers about weekly menus, special offers, and blog updates â€“ a great way to nurture the community.
Technology Choice: Select a platform (like Shopify, Squarespace with e-commerce, WordPress with WooCommerce) that balances ease of use for you to update content/inventory with the required features.
Building the Community:

Consistency: Regularly update the blog, calendar, and weekly offerings.
Engagement: Respond to comments and inquiries promptly.
Exclusivity: Make website visitors/newsletter subscribers feel "in the know."
Local Focus: Emphasize the Treasure Valley connection in your content.
Personality: Let the "dynamic duo" voice shine through in all communications.
Reliability: Deliver consistently delicious products as promised.
This framework provides a solid foundation for BoiseBakedGoods.com, balancing the practical need for online ordering with the important goal of fostering a loyal local community around your delicious creations!
